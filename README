When initially installing, you need to have a MySQL database setup and you must run snippets.sql on that database.

Once the tables are created, you need to create a file called config.php in ./includes/ with the following information in it:

<?php

$dbhost = 'host of database (usually localhost)';
$dbuser = 'database user';
$dbpass = 'database password';
$dbname = 'database name';

?>
